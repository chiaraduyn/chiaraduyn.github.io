This year I learned about software engineering and how fascinating it is. This complex field of study goes way beyond coding and building applications which I had the opportunity to work on as well. During my journey through this course, I've discovered two areas that I found personally interesting that have changed how I view software engineering. These topics are the world of development environments and the role of ethics software engineers have. 


## My Digital Toolbox
Developmental environments work almost the same as a tool box, but make it digital. This tool box has all the essentials for writing code such as VS Code (this is like your main work surface), debugging tools (helps find and fix errors), extensions like ESLint (similar to having guides and jigs that ensure everything stays straight and properly aligned), version control such as Git (a detailed project log where you can track all your changes and provides coding assistance), and live preview features (a quick way to test how your work looks and functions). When using these all together, my code will turn out clean and bug-free. This is what a good development environment should be like. The best part is seeing my code come to life with features like Live Preview that updates automatically after saving. Also when working with teammates, Git and GitHub made it a much easier process. All these extensions show how these development environments can be customized for any development needed. While we only used these tools for web development, they follow the same principles if you were to make mobile applications, embedded systems, or desktop software. 

## The Impact of Software
I also got the chance to learn more about the ethics in software engineering and how doing the right thing matters in every part of making software, no matter what kind of program I may build. I looked at stories like “College for Sarah” that showed how when software breaks, it can really hurt a person's life. This story taught me that when making software we need to think about “what happens if it breaks?”. In the story there is a bank whose software gets compromised and almost prevents a student from going to college as a result. This showed me three main things that are important in all types of software such as that real people use these programs, and mistakes can affect these people's lives in big ways. The second is that software needs a lot of testing and backup plans, whether it's a website or not. Lastly, if people trust software to do important things it must work properly. 


Aside from all of this, I also think there is a need to have ethical considerations about data collection, storage, and sharing for any software that handles user information. Engineers should carefully consider what data they collect and how they protect it. Not only this, but users should understand how their data is being used and engineers should also provide a clear user agreement which asks if it's okay to collect their information. 


## The Bigger Picture
Even though I learned by making websites in this class, the big ideas we studied like setting up coding tools and thinking about right and wrong, are important for all types of computer programming. Learning about these ideas in a broader way has helped me become better at making all kinds of computer programs and not just the specific tools we used in class. The rules about doing the right thing that I talked about,  like the ACM Code of Ethics for example, helps everyone who makes computer programs, not just people who make websites. In the same way, having my coding tools set up well helps no matter what kind of program I'm making. These basic ideas are like the building blocks for being a good and successful programmer that I will carry with me to the professional world after college.
