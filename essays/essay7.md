I remember when I first started college (2017), ChatGPT did not exist. Looking back, I was solely reliant on my own intelligence, information learned in class, and online resources. Today artificial Intelligence is changing how we learn in school, specifically in fields like software engineering which I've been taking classes on. In ICS 314 ( a class I took in the Fall of 2024) I used tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude AI because they are resources that can help students like me learn and solve programming problems. These technologies have since offered new ways to understand complicated software engineering concepts and complete assignments in a swift amount of time.

## My Personal Journey with AI

My experience with AI in the course varied from assignment to assignment. During Experience WODs like E06 (creating our professional persona on GitHub) I didn't feel the need to use any AI because there was a template that was provided for us to use on GitHub. For E18 which was a functional programming experience, I used ChatGPT to help create initial code structures. By doing this I was able to get quick information on how to possibly approach this programming challenge. For in-class practice WODs, I mainly used GitHub Copilot which I think is a great tool for any beginners. It reminds me of a coding partner because it suggests code completions that often helped me think through problems when I found myself at a dead end. However, I was careful not to rely on these tools too much during actual in-class work like the in-class WODâ€™s for example since I knew that it was important to develop my own coding skills.

For essays, I did use AI. I mostly used AI just to check spelling and grammar but not to write anything for me. I think that it's a good tool for catching typos since reading line by line can be tedious work. I think where I used AI the most was for the final project. GitHub Copilot and Claude AI helped me solve tricky coding errors and other issues we ran into like when we were deploying Vercel. When I run into complicated programming problems, my first reaction is not to use AI but I usually check out Stack Overflow. I find that these websites are more reliable. If I was unsuccessful in finding my answer there or another forum, I would then ask AI about specific error messages which helped me understand what might be going wrong.

## Impact on Learning and Practical Applications

Adding AI to this software engineering course and my life in general has really changed how I learned. These technologies are able to give me instant feedback and show me different ways to solve problems which is something I never had in my early college days . They have definitely helped me understand programming concepts better. But I was always careful to think critically and not just accept AI-generated solutions blindly.
Outside the classroom, I saw how AI could be useful in real-world software engineering. Even though I didn't work on big projects like HACC, I could see how these tools could help programmers by generating code, suggesting improvements, and quickly finding and fixing bugs. I'm sure that there are people that use it in the professional world as well.

## Challenges and Opportunities

I discovered some challenges with using AI and can share what I learned. Asking the right questions is an important factor,  if I didn't phrase my request carefully the results were often unhelpful or incorrect. That's why it's good to check what it's spitting out before copying and pasting it. I am also aware of the environmental impact that using AI has. All of these AI technologies consume a lot of water because they need it to cool down the computers. This has made me use AI more carefully, seeing it as a helpful tool but not a complete solution.

## Comparative Analysis and Future Considerations

Comparing AI-enhanced learning with traditional teaching methods showed interesting differences. AI tools could quickly generate information and code, but they couldn't replace the deep understanding that comes from working through problems manually and getting guidance from instructors.
The future of AI in software engineering education looks exciting but could be complicated. As these technologies improve, they might become better at understanding specific programming contexts and offering more personalized learning which makes it harder to know the academic integrity of a person. But it will always be important to balance technological help with building fundamental skills. They aren't replacements for thinking and learning, but they can be really helpful when used carefully. The key is to use AI strategically, understanding its strengths and limitations in education.
