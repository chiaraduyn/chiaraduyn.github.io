## The problem

   Textbooks are often expensive, especially if you are buying a new physical copy. After a class is over, most of these costly textbooks end up going unused, get discarded, or take up space on your shelf. By creating a sustainable solution that will help students save money,  we can also reduce textbook waste during their academic career. Providing a student-only space focused on saving them money will also build community trust for our site. 

## Project Idea/Solution

  An online campus wide marketplace here at UH Manoa where students can list their used textbooks for sale or rent to other students. When students list their textbooks, they can specify whether they want to sell or rent, and also give the condition and price. Students will be able to search through the site to browse listings based on course, departments or book title. This idea addresses the need for affordable textbooks while giving UH students a platform to recycle used books.


## Special Sauce

   To further gain trust aka our special sauce, there will be some sort of reputation system so that the more transactions a student completes, the higher seller rating they can get. This will help the reliability of the seller for any potential buyers or renters to see, as this rating is publicly available on the sellers profile. It could possibly provide feedback from other buyers as well. 


## Case Ideas

-New user gets to the landing page, creates an account or logs in, and searches for a specific textbook. From there you can search for a textbook by course name, department, or title. 
                      
-Logged in user finds a textbook, and messages the seller to negotiate a price or arrange any sale/rent details. Haven't decided how this interaction will happen yet. 
              
-Logged in user goes to the selling page and uploads a textbook to sell/rent. There will be fields for the necessary book details like the price and condition. This will be visible to others. 
                             
-Logged in users receive a message from a potential buyer/renter and then they can respond to the student inquiring about a certain textbook. They will then schedule a meeting place and time. 

## Beyond the Basics

To add extra convenience, users could have the option to enable notifications when a book is available. For example, if a user is looking for a specific textbook but doesnâ€™t find it, they could opt to be notified if a new listing for that book appears on the platform. Notifications could be managed via email.
