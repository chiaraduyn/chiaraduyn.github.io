Learning to code is like learning a new language that helps us understand and use technology better. Now most people can learn and write code, but does it work well? Is it easy to understand and keep updated? This is where coding standards fall into place. They are more than just a set of rules; they are a valuable learning tool that helps developers deepen their understanding of a programming language.

## What are Coding Standards?

Coding standards are guidelines for writing code that ensure code is written in a consistent way. These standards go beyond the visual style of the code, for example, things like indentation. They also make it easier for others to read, understand, and modify code. Without this, it can be like trying to understand a new language without any translation. For me, if the code is messy and hard to follow, I probably won't be able to understand what is happening or be able to make any changes.

## Bringing Code Together

When collaborating with others, I think that coding standards are very important to follow. In projects that I've had in the past, where multiple people are contributing code, not having any coding standards led to having a project that doesn't flow together or even look the same. This makes it extremely hard to follow. These standards create a shared understanding of how the code should look and function, while also allowing for smooth collaboration.

## My Secret Weapon

Recently, I've been using a tool called ESLint with a code editor called Visual Studio Code, and it's been a game-changer. ESLint is a linter, which is a tool that checks your code for errors and enforces coding standards. There is also real-time feedback as you're coding, letting you know if you have any potential issues like syntax errors, poor practices, or even something as simple as incorrect indentation. It's like having a personal grammar checker for my code plus more! This has improved my coding style by avoiding common mistakes and adopting more efficient patterns. I've also learned new things about the programming language I'm using currently, TypeScript.

## From Overload to Opportunity

At first, I found myself a bit overwhelmed with the number of errors that popped up when running ESLint, especially since my previous projects didn't have strict coding standards. I have used something called Checkstyle that checks for errors in JGrasp which uses Java. This reminded me a lot of ESLint. Soon after, I realized that most of these errors were easy to fix. What seemed daunting at first became an excellent learning experience. I now rely on ESLint to not only catch issues in my code but to guide me into writing better code from the start, not just fixing errors as they happen.

## Conclusion

Coding standards are more than just rules to follow; they help developers of all levels to write better code and work well with others. Overall, I think they have many benefits. ESLint also gives quick feedback to the coder, which makes it easier to stick to these standards and want to keep using ESLint (because who doesn't like a quick loading time?). Even though the projects themselves can be challenging at times, the satisfaction of writing clean and maintainable code makes it all worth it in the end.
