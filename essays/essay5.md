## What is Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap 5 is a tool that can help you build websites efficiently in HTML and CSS (JavaScript included,  but currently working exclusively with HTML and CSS). A lot of the code is prewritten for you, such as buttons, navigation bars, and layouts. This saves a lot of time since you don't need to take the time to create all the styling yourself. Bootstrap has been a useful tool for me, especially when doing timed coding exercises in class (Workout of the Day, read more about this under “Essays”).
The Bootstrap 5 framework can be intimidating for beginners, especially if you don't know how to use it. When I first started using Bootstrap 5 in Visual Studio Code I often found myself asking, "Why should i even use Bootstrap?". With raw HTML and CSS, I felt like I had a clearer understanding of what was happening. Yet UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 are worth the effort despite the initial learning curve and frustration. 

## Conquering Complexity 

Bootstrap 5 can be challenging to learn at first since it introduces a host of classes, components, and utilities that initially feel overwhelming. The setup process involves linking your Bootstrap CSS files to an HTML file. From here, you can learn about responsive design principles and start to become familiar with the large number of options they have for pre-built components. 
There is one thing, Bootstrap’s complexity is a trade-off. By giving up raw HTML and CSS, you gain a powerful toolkit for building modern, responsive websites. In the long run, Bootstrap begins to save you time once you understand its workings, especially when creating responsive layouts.
