## What is Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap 5 is a tool that can help you build websites efficiently in HTML and CSS (JavaScript included, but right now I am currently working exclusively with HTML and CSS). A lot of the code is prewritten, such as buttons, navigation bars, and layouts. This saves a lot of time since I don’t need to take the time to create all the styling myself. Bootstrap has been a useful tool for me, especially when doing timed coding exercises in class (called a Workout of the Day, read more about them [here](https://chiaraduyn.github.io/essays/essay1.html)). The Bootstrap 5 framework can be intimidating for beginners (which I was), especially if you don’t know how to use it. When I first started using Bootstrap 5 in Visual Studio Code I found myself asking, “Why should I even use Bootstrap?”. With raw HTML and CSS, I felt like I had a clearer understanding of what was happening. Yet UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 are worth the effort despite the initial learning curve and slight frustration.

## Conquering Complexity 

At first, using Bootstrap can be challenging to learn since it introduces a new list of classes and utilities that were foreign to me. The setup process involves linking your Bootstrap CSS files to an HTML file. From here, you can learn some of the principles of responsive design and start to become familiar with all the options they have for pre-built components. When using Bootstrap there is a trade-off, which is a slower time complexity. But by giving up raw HTML and CSS, I no longer have to start my code from scratch and be worry-free of any possible errors. I also gained powerful tools for building more modern and responsive (built with mobile-first responsiveness in mind) websites, so in the long run, it’s worth it since it saves me time otherwise.


## Leaving Raw HTML and CSS Behind

Before using Bootstrap, I was capable of crafting simple layouts and styling pages to meet basic needs using HTML and CSS. As soon as I had projects that became more complicated, the challenge of managing layout details while keeping a professional-looking webpage became harder, for example, making sure it looks good on various devices like phones or tablets. To solve these issues, Bootstrap provides a collection of ready-to-use components, a powerful grid system, and helpful utilities that make common tasks less taxinge. For example, centering elements or creating a responsive grid can turn into something very complex when relying only on CSS. With Bootstrap’s grid system, I can easily organize my page with only a handful of classes since it automatically adjusts to fit different screen sizes. It also has many common UI patterns that have been solved by frameworks. Bootstrap has probably saved me many hours of tuning up a layout for a webpage.
