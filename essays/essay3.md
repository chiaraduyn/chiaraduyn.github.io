  Practicing good communication is important for software engineers especially when in need of help or answers. In Eric Raymond’s essay “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” he provides plenty of valuable advice when creating questions that will get you a useful response. In this essay, I will be examining two questions from StackOverflow, one example will represent the “smart way” to ask a question and the other will represent the “not so smart way”. By doing this, I will hopefully have a better understanding on how to ask the right questions when needing any computer programming help in the future. 


## The “Smart” Question

  There is a question titled “How can I sort a list of dictionaries by a value in Python?” (link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/72899)) and was asked by a user named Super Kai - Kazuya Ito. Here's what made the question smart: The user needed to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific value in each dictionary since they were working on a data processing task and needed this sorted list to create a report. The user showed efforts by including a sample list of dictionaries and some code that they had previously tried but wasn't working as they wanted to. 

  The question is specific,clear, and straightforward which is why I consider it a “smart” question. They explained exactly what they wanted to do(sort a list of dictionaries) and provide example code which makes it easier for other users to understand the issue. By giving context of the task they were doing and what was needed to achieve it, responders are more likely to give advice that is useful. Their effort to clearly explain something also means they are serious about solving the problem.

  Overall, the responses were very helpful and I saw lots of people giving suggestions on how to use Python’s sorted() function and provided different ways to sort based on the dictionary values. These detailed answers helped Super Kai fix their code and better understand the sorting process. The interaction between users was productive and gave a clear solution.


## The “Not Smart” Question

  Now let's look at the question titled “I am trying to figure out why my code is not working” (link [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/62227709)). This question was asked by a user named chole stedings. There are a few reasons why the question is less effective. The problem starts with the user not specifying what their code was supposed to do or what exactly was wrong with it, in fact there is not much context at all. There was no background information about the project or the task at hand, only a snippet of the code was provided, and there was no description of any previous attempts to fix the issue.

  I would say this question is not smart due to its lack of specificity. It is too general and fors not provide enough information for others to understand what the issue may be. Without any context or background, it's difficult for others to give helpful advice or solutions. Also, giving small portions of code and not describing previous efforts can imply that the user hasn't tried to solve the problem for very long on their own, which makes it harder for others to offer meaningful help. 

  As a result, the responses to this question are minimal and often pointed out that more details were needed to give a good answer. Many users suggested that chole stedings should edit the question to include additional information. And due to all of this, the user did not receive helpful answers and get the assistance they may have needed at the time being. 

## Insights
  Looking at both “smart” and “not smart” questions taught me some important lessons about getting effective help online. First, being specific and giving context is very important. Cleary describing a problem makes it much easier for others to give useful answers. Second, showing an effort to solve the problem yourself by including code or explaining what you've tried demonstrates that you respect others' time. This makes people more willing to provide better responses. Finally, clear and well-structured questions make it easier for others to understand and give you the help you need. 


## Conclusion
  By following Eric Raymond's guidelines, software engineers (including myself) can improve their communication skills and their interactions with online communities such as StackOverflow. Clear, specific questions that provide context and show effort are more likely to receive valuable assistance and effective feedback for problems.
